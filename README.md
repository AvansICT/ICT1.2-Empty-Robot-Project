# ICT1.2 - Empty Robot Project

This repository is a minimal starter project for students building a robot application.

It contains a quick example in `Program.cs` prints a greeting and toggles an LED:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello Robot!");

Led lampje = new Led(1); // kies wel de juiste pin!
lampje.SetOn();
```

What this project contains

-- Minimal .NET project targeting `net9.0`.

- Example hardware folders included under `Hardware/`:
  - `GyroCompass/` — compass and gyro helpers
  - `Speaker/` — simple WAV speaker helper
  - `Touchpad/` — touchpad input helper

Getting started

1. Prerequisites

- .NET 9 SDK (to match `net9.0` target)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Install the Avans-StatisticalRobot VS Code extension to connect to the robot

2. Build

From the project root run:

```
dotnet build RobotProject.csproj
```

3. Run

Use the VS Code extension to deploy to the robot

Notes and tips for students

- Make sure you connect to the robot before attempting hardware-specific code. Use the Avans-StatisticalRobot extension for VS Code.
- Start by experimenting with sensors and actuators to learn the hardware APIs.
- When moving from experiments to a real application, design a simple class structure and avoid putting everything into `Program.cs`. A small class diagram helps.
- If you need MQTT communication, add the required NuGet package and the SimpleMQTTclient to the project.
- The `Led` example uses a pin number — choose the correct pin for your robot hardware before turning things on.

Good luck and have fun building your robot!
